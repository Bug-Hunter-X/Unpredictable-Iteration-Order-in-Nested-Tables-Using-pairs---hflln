This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Lua related to the unpredictable iteration order of nested tables when using the `pairs` iterator. The bug occurs because `pairs` does not guarantee a specific order of traversal, leading to potentially unexpected results when processing nested structures. The solution involves using a custom iteration function to enforce a consistent order.  The `bug.lua` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.lua` provides a corrected version.
